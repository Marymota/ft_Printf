# ft_printf - Custom Implementation of printf()

## Summary

The ft_printf project aims to recreate the functionality of the standard C library function printf().
This exercise provides a moderate level of difficulty and offers valuable insights into variadic functions in C. 
Upon completion, I had the option to incorporate ft_printf() into my [Libft](https://github.com/Marymota/Libft), enhancing its functionality for future C projects.

## Mandatory Part

This project is a library containing ft_printf(), mimicking the original printf().
ft_printf() is capable of handling the following conversions: 'cspdiuxX%'.

## Bonus Part

ft_printf() can manage the flags '-0.' and field minimum width under all conversions.
Can also manage flags '# +'
